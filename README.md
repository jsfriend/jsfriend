- 👋 Hi, I’m @jsfriend
- 👀 I’m interested in software engineering! My favorite language is Java.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the software engineering cycle and the 4 components of object oriented programming.   
     Apart of my Software Development class at NCSU, I am building a course registration tool.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on undergraduate research, start-up companies, and anywhere I can work in a team setting
     working on interesting engineering problems.
